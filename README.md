# DistributionalEffectsCarbonPricing

This thesis evaluates the vertical and horizontal distributional effects of carbon pricing in Romania and Bulgaria. Using a series of statics microsimulations, it is shown that carbon pricing is regressive before redistribution. Additionally, it is proven that that by choosing an optimal revenue recycling strategy, governments can assure tax neutrality. In this sense, two revenue recycling schemes are analyzed: a lump-sum transfer, and a normative transfer based on Rawlsian principles. The lump-sum transfer partially alleviates regressivity in both countries, while the Rawlsian transfer makes carbon pricing progressive in Romania, and neutral in Bulgaria. Using a series of semi-structured interviews with experts from Eastern Europe, this thesis assesses the viability of the Rawlsian transfer. The main finding is that implementing this revenue recycling scheme could be achieved by framing it as a response to energy poverty concerns. This would avoid the potential backlash of the public against expansive social policy, while solving the challenge of designing climate policy under uncertainty.
